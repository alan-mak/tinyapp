# Alan's TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (similar to  bit.ly, tinyurl.com, ow.ly).

### Why Do We Need URL Shortners?
* Character limitations on social media posts
  * We wouldn't wanna spend 50% of our allowed characters on just a link
* They allow for people to remember links easier
  * 8 letters would be a lot easier to remember than 30
